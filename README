1. Adding the Aos layer to your build
=====================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the aos layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the aos layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-aos \
    "


2. Misc
=======

Set PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/runc = "runc-opencontainers" to build runc from
opencontainers.

Set AOS_RUNNER to define which runner will be used to run Aos services.
Currently supported: runc and crun. Default is runc.
